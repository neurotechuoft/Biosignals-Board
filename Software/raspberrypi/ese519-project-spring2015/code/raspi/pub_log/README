There are various ways to do this, 

1. Write a node.js server and client
	- node raspi.js 
	- open the test.html page on the client side
        - Good for visualizing the data

2. Write a simple tcp client and server implementation
	- Very simple python server client implementation something like http://pymotw.com/2/socket/tcp.html

3. Use netcat command
	- run cat data.dat | pv -b | nc -l 3333 on the server side, replace data.dat with the file you want to send
	- run nc <ip-address-of-server> 3333 | pv -b > savedData.dat on the client side
	- To simultaneously save data as well as process it, use pipes

I found 3 to be the easiest as its super easy to interface with files and pipes. 
I recommened using 3 for this project. 

If the data wants to be visualized then just run the node version. 
This is also extensible because we can easily implement SPI directly on the raspi and readout the data to the pc. (thoughts?)
