# Meeting Notes

Date:  August 30, 2017  
Time:  8:30 pm - 11:00 pm  
Location:  Phone call  
Attendees:  Albert, Oishe, Mikael

## Agenda

## Notes
  - Went over all parts of OpenBCI schematic
  - Power
    - Can use battery. Raspberry Pi can also be battery powered
    - Issues:
      - Using unipolar power supply: AVDD = 5V, AVSS = 0V, DVDD = 3.3V, DVDD = 0V
        - Therefore we need to use a 6V power supply with a 5V voltage regulator for AVDD and a 3V regulator for DVDD
          - Caveats: 3V regulator can get very hot due to power dissapation
	- OpenBCI uses bipolar power supply: AVDD = 2.5V, AVSS = -2.5V, DVDD = 3.3V. DGND = 0V
	  - This way 4 chips (Voltage inverter to get -2.5 V, +/- 2.5, 3.3V, regulators)
  - ESD 
    - OpenBCI uses QUAD TVS chips 
      - Chips are just diodes, [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/product/TPD4E1B06)
  - Discussed all ADS connections
    - Leave BIAS pins unused -> connect to AGND or DGND
    - Analog inputs: Use referential montage (Refer to page 67 of ADS1299 Datasheet)
	
  - Which pins to probe
    - Breakout AGND, DGND
    - Internal oscillator to trigger oscilloscope
      - SCLK might be a better option
    - Review Design for Testability guidelines, especially for Digital I/O
      - [Designing testability into a PCB](http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/all-aboard-/4434254/Designing-testability-into-a-PCB)
      - [Design guidelines for In-circuit testing](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/353296/ebook_pdfs/Design_guidelines_for_in-circuit_testability.pdf): These are more applicable for the digital pins than the analog pins.
	
## To-Do
  - Topics that still need discussion
  - Power
	- Raspberry Pi will be battery powered
	- Use the same battery to power Rpi and ADS
	- 5V voltage regulator to power Pi and ADS
	- 3.3 voltage regulator to power ADS.
	- Look into power consumption
  - ESD
  - Research
    - Oishe ESD chips, cost
    - Albert: Digital inputs/outputs and breakouts
    - Mikael: Look for EAGLE models for voltage regulators, which chips we can purchase
  
## Next Meeting Agenda
  - Put EAGLE schematic together

## Next Meeting: Sunday Sep 03, 2017, Bahen 3200
