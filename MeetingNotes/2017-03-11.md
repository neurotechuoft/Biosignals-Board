## Meeting Notes:
- Albert: looked into ADS documentation
  - seems to be designed specifically for PCB
    - has layout recommendations for PCB printing
    - we could ask Connor from OpenBCI how they 'lab-tested' and made prototypes initially
  - documentation seems very thorough and readable
    - stuff on how to set up and program
    - pin functions, etc
  - we might need to buy the ADS1299EEG-FE Kit for research development:

## TODO:
- Albert: read through ADS1299 datasheet and summarize the Applications and Implementation section by March 18th
    - applications/how to use with other circuits
