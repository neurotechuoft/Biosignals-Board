# Meeting Notes

Date:  August 27, 2017  
Time:  12:00pm - 5:00pm  
Location:  BA3200  
Attendees: Albert, Mikael, Oishe 

## Agenda
 - Go through OpenBCI schematics to see what we can import into EAGLE
 - Go over physical form factor of board and how we will connect it to the Raspberry Pi

## Notes
  - Physical form factor:
    - Breakout pins for probing
    - Physical size: smaller than the OpenBCI.
  - AJ's 8 channel
    - http://g.recordit.co/Q0xsLgfqvI.gif
    - Uses ADS1299 (only negative inputs are broken out)
    - Can use 16 input if have two rows of breakout
      - Maybe get in contact with AJ on NeurotechX Slack
    - Has two/three SOT chips, could either be voltage regulators or step-down converters.
  - Power:
    - Battery-powered: Want to avoid power surges if plugged into the wall
    - Will need 3.3V power supply for DVDD and 5V for AVDD
  - Supplementary chips
    - Voltage regulator 
    - ESD chips
    - termination resistors?
      - Might only be needed for very high frequency signals > 8MHz
  - ADS1299
    - Would be good to get second ADS1299 so we can manufacture another PCB if the first one doesn't work, however, not essential
  - EAGLE:
    - ADS1299 EAGLE Library:
      - Has schematic: https://github.com/adamfeuer/hackeeg-shield/tree/master/eagle
    - Need to make schematics for all parts first, then convert to board layout

  - Completed
    - Everyone:
      - Created EAGLE project
      - Imported ADS1299 library, added ADS1299 schematic to project
      - try converting schematic to PCB:    	
        - Works: Pin layout is correct
      - Went through tutorial to make low pass filter
        - http://dl36mmdz94630.cloudfront.net/uploads/eagle_resources/files/000/002/278/original/step-by-step_tutorial.pdf?1484967932
      - Github:
        - Pushed .brd and .sch files to Github
        - Tried out editing and pushing files, changes can be seen in XML file.
	- Use log.txt to log every change and commit message
  - Some links:
     - How to install and setup EAGLE: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-eagle    

## To-Do
  - Oishe:
    - Start Google Drive folder for textbook pdfs of textbooks Bruno posted
    - Go through textbooks and see what is important
  - All of us:
    - Go through DesignSpark OpenBCI file and see what we can import into EAGLE
    - Learn how to use EAGLE
    - Research:
      - Go through pins and finalize connections so we can start do schematic on Wednesday
        - Read through important sections of ADS1299 Databook.
      - General PCB guidelines and routing procedures for low noise
      - Options for version control and collaboration with EAGLE
        - Examples: eaglediff, Fusion
  - Next meeting agenda:
    - Make ADS schematic using EAGLE, start PCB

## Next Meeting: Wednesday Aug 30, 2017
