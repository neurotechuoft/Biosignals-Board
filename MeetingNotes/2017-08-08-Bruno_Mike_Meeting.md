Date:  August 8, 2017  
Time:  11:00 am  
Location:  Design Center + Office PT374D  
Attendees:
- Oishe Farhan
- Bruno Korst, [Communications & Advanced Electronics Lab Manager](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/undergraduates/hardware-computer-labs/communications-lab/)
- Mike Mehramiz, [Design Centre Lab Manager](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/undergraduates/hardware-computer-labs/design-centre/)

## Notes
- PCB manufactoring
  - Consider using EAGLE for PCB design
    - [free trial](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview#)
    - Look for tutorials at
      [SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-schematic?_ga=2.90055195.1260016087.1502206835-581315873.1502206835)
  - [4PCB](https://www.4PCB.com)
    - More reliable to have board printed and shipped
    - inquire about new customer and student discount
  - Design Centre has resources for populating and testing board
    - fine tip soldering with microscope
    - oven for SMD
    - osciliscopes
    - power supply
    - function generators
  - Email for access to lab spaces and equipment
- Reading material
  - Build Your Own Printed Circuit Board - Al Williams
  - Designing Embedded Hardware - John Catsoulis
  - The Art of Electronics - Paul Horowitz
  - Designing Circuit Boards With EAGLE - Matthew Scarpino
  - One more about extra precautions for low noise
- Further topics for web queries
  - designing PCB for low noise
  - ds PIC controllers
  - beagle bone controller
  - consider working with the TI
    [launchpad](http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/tools-software/launchpads/overview/overview.page)
    - might be easier to interface with TI chips

## To-Do
- Finalize PCB schematic
  - Have design reviewed
- Order PCB design online
- Populate chip and test for power-on sequence
- Follow [openBCI](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/02-Cyton) procedure
- Finalize decision to use one of the following:
  - Atmel ATmega (arduino)
  - PIC variation
  - launchpad
