# Meeting Notes - General Meeting

# Bio-signals Board General Meeting
Date: June 9, 2017  
Time: 6:15 PM – 8:15 PM  
Location: Clubhouse Meeting Room (Rm. 503)  
Attendees: Oishe, Albert, Mikael, Rustem, Musa, Alisa  

### Agenda:
-	Establish consensus on project’s final goal
-	Determine hours of commitment and who will focus on which aspects
-	Set deadlines for project completion

### Notes:
-	Analog and Digital portions will be the same irrespective of final application
-	Software and final application up for discussion
-	Options for Software
   - Raspberry Pi
     - Sayan found code for Raspberry Pi and ADS1299 (links on Slack)
     - IOT solution
       - Do processing on Raspberry Pi
       - Raspberry Pi sends commands to control peripherals => More applications
       - Mobile app a possibility
         - May need to outsource
       - More innovative, more options for processing
       - More connectivity options:
         - USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
         - SPI, GPIO
    - Arduino
      - Reiterating on OpenBCI
      - OpenBCI already has ADS1299-Arduino library, little innovation can be done
#### Vote: Raspberry Pi wins, 5 - 0

###	Competition requires 5 stage pipeline
 - Acquisition (EEG recommended, EMG accepted)
 - Signal processing
 - Data transmission
   - What does it mean by a distant computer?
   - Only 200 Hz required
 - Real time visualization
   - How to differentiate OpenBCI and Raspberry Pi
   - Can make this stage optional, i.e Connect screen just for competition, remove for other applications
 - Data recording

### Team and Roles
 - Analog:
   - Mikael: Electrodes
   - Oishe: Analog signal processing, filtering
   - Albert
 - Digital
   - Oishe
   - Albert: Control of ADS1299, protocol
 - Software
   - Musa will lead
   - Rustem

### Raspberry Pi options
 -	Compute Model
 -	Raspberry Pi Model 3 B
 -	$400 budget for all 3 projects
 -	(Oishe already has a Raspberry Pi Zero)

### Project Timeline: See Project_Timeline.ods

### Meeting Times:
 -	Tuesday: 6:30 pm - 10 pm
 -	Saturday Meeting: 12 pm – 3 pm
 -	Sunday:  12 pm to 3 pm (May move to later to overlap with MindType meeting)
