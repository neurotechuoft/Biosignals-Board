## Meeting Notes
- Discussed issues with design wrt to competition rubric
  - Will IOT solution not meet distance requirements?
    - `Data Transmission: to a distant computer wirelessly or not`
  - Where will RaspberryPI display graphs if at all?
    - `Real-time visualization: of signal in the time and frequency domains, for each acquisition channel`
  - How will RaspberryPI save data?
    - `Data Recording: must be stored on a computer with appropriate data format for latter use`
- Other issues on ADS1299 chip
  - chip is specifically designed for PCB mount
    - How will we prototype with the bigger breakout board
      - Capacitors for power are required to be as close as possible to the chip
    - Should we design a PCB strip with software and have it shipped?
- Signal Processing needs to be designed
  - `remove artifacts and noise`
    - ECG artifacts
    - motion artificats
  - Discuss whether analog or digital filtering
- For the software we need a headstart on bluetooth reception
  - Find out easy programming solution to recieve data over bluetooth

## Priorities
- Need to ask competition holders about IOT solution
- Need to acquire lab space or an osciliscope/function generator

# TODO:
- __Oishe__
  - Generate clean sine wave with arduino for testing
    - Create low pass filtering
      - cutoff 12kHz
      - get rid of 32kHz carrier wave
  - Create ADS1299 safe handling procedure
  - ADS1299 power
    - add Capacitors
    - find clean source of 5V power and 3.3V power
- __Albert__
  - Compile arduino code for ADS1299 startup
  - Figure out procedure for SPI communication
  - Look into bluetooth communication with computer
- __Sayan, Musa__
  - Look into bluetooth communication with computer
    - what language provides easiest:
      - communication
      - graphing
      - digital filtering and artifacts removal
