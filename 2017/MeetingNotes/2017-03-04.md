## Meeting Notes
- read through competition guidelines, needed to see what to ask
- simplest setup:
  - ADS -> Arduino -> Bluetooth -> computer
- Albert: better to stick to the requirements of the competition
  - and innovate if we have time

## Priorities
- Main: Acquisition--finish by June 1
  - connecting ADS to some sort of processor (Arduino or Raspberry Pi)
- other teams (VitReous, WallEEG) will make progress on signal processing, visualization, etcetc

# TODO:
- ask about whether data transmission needs to be there (ie can we do on Raspberry Pi)
- ask for alpha power: what is open/close paradigm?
- in general: do we HAVE to have the 5 requirements?
- extra points for innovation?
