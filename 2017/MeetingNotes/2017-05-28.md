# Work Session Notes

## Attendees: Albert, Oishe

Time: 1:00-3:00 pm, BA3200

- Continued research on test signal generation and power supply
  - Test Signal Generation
    - Arduino DDS Signal Generator (http://makezine.com/2009/11/30/generating-high-quality-sine-waves/)
      - Arduino + RLC circuit + potentiometer to generator high quality sine waves
      - Looked promising, but components were too expensive, so we decided on using an Arduino to generate square waves which can be low-pass filtered with an RC circuit
  - Power Supply
    - ADS1299 supports two power supply modes:
      - Unipolar (GND = 0V, VDD = 5V)
      - Bipolar (GND = -2.5V, VDD = +2.5V)
        - Bipolar supply is more suitable if active electrodes with biopolar amps are used
        - OpenBCI uses bipolar supply
        - We are still undecided on which one to use, bought bought enough caps for both (Bipolar supply requires two more caps than unipolar)
 - Materials:
   - We already have a lot of resistors, but we had to buy capacitors for the test signal generator + chip power supply
   - The chip socket we bought does not fit on a standard breadboard, so we either need to solder it to a pcb or use jumper cables
   
- Miscellaneous:
   - We're still considering whether we need anti-static tweezer to handle the chip or not
   - Oishe found Designspark PCB which can open the CAD files in the OpenBCI documentation
