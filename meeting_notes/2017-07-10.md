# Meeting Notes

Date:  July 10, 2017
Time:  4:30pm
Location:  Design Studio Mining building
Attendees: Oishe, Max

## Agenda
- Introduce Neurotech UofT
- Mention competition and discuss projects
- Discuss equipment and resources
- Further help and resoures

## Notes
- Design and Fabrication Space
	- General tools and equipment
		- Great 3D printer space!!!
		- Osciliscopes x5
		- old function generators
		- soldering station
			- might not be very good tips
			- we'll have to bring our own pcb's'
		- CNC machine with drill bit tips
	- Discussed PCB fabrication process
		- might be able to use the CNC machine to drill paths onto copper board
			- unfortunately limited in size, >1mm
			- good for drilling hole from one surface to other
		- Printing with laserjet/toner onto transparant paper/coated paper
			- etching methods
	- Bio radio toolkit
		- Allows collection of EEG data
		- ten20 paste included
		- electrodes included
- Need the club to be connected with an ENGINEERING PROF
	- Has to sign an agreement allowing us to use the equipment
		-	specifically to sign out kits/osciliscopes/etc
	- Recommended profs to connect with
		- Berj Berdakjian
		- Christopher Yip
	- Suggested connecting with Dawn Kilkenny
		- Undergradute head of IBBME
		- Ask for who to contact if we want funding
		- Discuss our multi-disciplinery club structure
- Max will email for tomorrow:
	- a full equipment list
	- the agreement doc that prof has to fill out
  - a maker space near UofT with more specialized equipment
- Need to have Lab safety training from Max to use space
- Max is super knowledgeable about the signals and general equipment
  - Won't be very helpful with the pcb manufacturing
- Max is very busy for the month
  - He will be away from Jul 21 - Aug 05
  - Design Studio will be very busy after September
    - Courses will have first priority
- Max is unavailable this Wednesday
- Scheduled to meet him Thursday

## To-Do
- Email Profs for helping us and being associated with us
	- Berj Berdakjian
	- Christopher Yip
- Email Dawn Kilkenny
	- To discuss clubs information
	- Funding opportunities	
  - Also work on vitreous and demo it
- Research PCB fabrication procedures
	- Limitations
		- cost
		- complexity
	- Looking into CNC PCB model
		- Will have to design in AutoCAD/solidworks
		- create SDL or SVG files for laying paths and drilling
		- look for what boards we could actually use
		- will they work with our tiny chips?
	- Looking into PCB design with etching
		- Decide what kind of paper to use
		- If laserjet will work or if toner printer
		- Research chemicals needed/cost/methods
		- Safety of chemicals -> where to do etching / storage
		- Reusibility of chemicals
			

## Next Meeting with Max: Thusrday after 12pm
