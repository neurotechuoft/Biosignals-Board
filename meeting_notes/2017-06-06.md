# Meeting Notes

## Attendees: Albert, Oishe

Time: 6:30 - 8:15pm, Clubhouse

## Agenda
- Test for stable voltage
- Finish connections for Arduino
- Power

## Notes
- Test for stable voltage
  - We think it should be safe to power with arduino nano
    - similar model as the openBCI
  - Arduino nano using power from Albert's computer
    - 4.815 V
    - 3.441 V
  - Arduino Uno Albert's computer
    - 5.095 V
    - can't find 3.3V value
- Connected 4 pins for SPI to arduino
- Did not power up because there wasn't enough time

## To-Do
- Connected the rest of the pins to either pull up or pull down
  - Oishe:
    - look into pullup-pulldown weak-strong resistors
    - Arduino signal generator DDS
  - Albert:
    - Write up all the different connections neccesary for different testing conditions
      - power up - ground or set all other pins
      - noise calculations using grounded electrodes
      - etc.
