# Meeting Notes

Date:  July 19, 2017  
Time:  7:00pm - 9:30pm  
Location:  BA3200  
Attendees: Oishe, Albert, Musa, Sayan  

## Agenda
- Stepback and re-evaluate goals
- Merge Digital and Software -> Digital
  - Set primary objective

## Notes
> * Natural Planning Model Framework
>   - Purpose: What is the main reason?
>   - Vison: What does success look like?
>   - Ideas: Actionable? What is the next action?
>   - Structure: Organize by sub-projects, deadline, and context
>   - Engage: What's the first action? Start!

- Re-evauate project goal using NPM
- Purpose
  - Make something useful that collects EEG
    - Very vague statement
- Vision
  - Simple + reproducible
    - Ready for competition deadline
    - Something that works
  - Market Ready Product
    - This is for improving on project
    - initiate after minimal viable product complete
## To-Do
- Ideas + Structure
  - Analog: Complete PCB design by Aug 7
    - [ ] Choose software for PCB design
    - [ ] Import diagrams from OpenBCI model
    - [ ] Electrode connection ports
    - [ ] Analog amp/filtering
      - [ ] TI sample chips
    - [ ] ADS1299 housing
      - [ ] chipsocket for soldering
    - [ ] Arduino housing
      - [ ] ATmega328 chip + components
    - [ ] RPI connection ports
  - Digital and Software (from most urgent to least urgent)
    - [ ] Understand pipeline from Arduino to Raspberry Pi
      - [ ] Review and evaluate tradeoffs (speed, ease of implementation in terms of hardware and software, etc.) between different protocols  
        - [ ] USB
        - [ ] I2C
        - [ ] UART
        - [ ] SPI
        - Resources:
          - A nice explanation of how [SPI, I2C and UART work with Arduino](http://www.deviceplus.com/how-tos/arduino-guide/arduino-communication-protocols-tutorial/)
    - [ ] Go over OpenBCI code (either 32-bit or 8-bit) to understand how the OpenBCI handles its communication pipeline and identify what we can borrow or improve from their code.
        - [OpenBCI-8-Bit-firmware](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_8bit): This library is coded for the OpenBCI 8bit Board and the Atmega328 (Arduino Uno), so it will be more similar to what our code will look like.
        - [OpenBCI-32-Bit-firmware](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_32bit_Library/tree/master): This library is written for the 32-bit PIC processor on the OpenBCI Cyton, which is the board our club has. 
    - [ ] Research limitations of using the Atmega328 instead of the PIC32 processor that the OpenBCI Cyton uses. 
  
  - Other tasks
    - [ ] Email Christoper Yip and Berj Berdajkian
    - [ ] Re connect breadboard digital connections
    - [ ] Edit power up sequence arduino code
    - [ ] Test power up sequence at Design Studio
    - [ ] Distribute equipment sheet and liability form from Max's email
    - [ ] Come up with outline for 10-min video
    - [ ] **For next meeting: Research and make notes on the four communication protocols mentioned above. This way we can review and make an informed decision on our pipeline design.**
## Next Meeting: Mon Jul 24 7pm, Clubhouse
