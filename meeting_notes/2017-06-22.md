Attendees: Albert, Oishe, Mikael, Musa

## Agenda
* Analog:
  - Mikael: Started work on EEG electrodes head net  
  - Oishe: Looked at [OpenHardwareExG](http://openelectronicslab.github.io/OpenHardwareExG/) schematics on KiCad
  - For next meeting:
    - Mikael: Continue work on electrodes
    - Oishe: Look into protection/shielding circuits, experiment with preamplifiers
* Digital:  
  - Albert: Looked at OpenHardwareExG code
    - Board is a combination of the Arduino Due and ADS1298
    - Code uses Arduino SPI library for ADS-Arduino communication
    - OpenBCI-Arduino library does not use Arduino libraries, SPI code looks broken?!
  - For next meeting: Modify OpenBCI library to use Arduino SPI library

* Notes:
  - Team needs OpenBCI, Mikael for electrode testing, Albert/Oishe for testing code
  - Should get Raspberry Pi by next meeting (UPDATE: Albert received Rpi on Friday)
