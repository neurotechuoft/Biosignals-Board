# Meeting Notes

Date:  July 09, 2017
Time:  12:00pm - 3:00pm
Location:  BA3200
Attendees: Oishe, Albert, Musa, Mikael, Sayan

## Agenda
  - Try flashing OpenBCI with DefaultBoard.ino Arduino Sketch
  - Decide on budget (i.e. for TI parts, estimate cost of PCB printing)
  - Research PCB software to use
  - Research analog staging and filtering setup

## Notes
  - Budget:
    - PCB Printing:
  	  - Check if UofT has any discounts for PCB Printing
  	  - Oishe estimates $20-$30
