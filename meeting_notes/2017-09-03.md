# Meeting Notes

Date:  September 03, 2017  
Time:  1:00pm - 3:00pm  
Location:  Bahen Third Floor  
Attendees:  Albert, Mikael

## Agenda
  - Work on schematic for ADS1299 and all supplementary parts
    - To-Do:
      - Make scehamtic for power supplies
      - Try connecting two schematics, like power supply to ESD

## Notes
  - EAGLE libraries found by Mikael
  	- In DesignSpark can search for Chip part using [RS Component Search engine](https://designspark.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001492765-Import-PCB-Part-Library-parts-to-EAGLE)
  	  - Problem is can't login in using DesignSpark to get ECAD model (EAGLE equivalent of DS library)
	- Can look for equivalent components in EAGLE, do not need to use EXACT same parts as OpenBCI
  - Using CAD:
  	- Look up:
  	  - Snap to grid, Snap to node in EAGLE
      - Naming nets in EAGLE
      - Need to eventually decide on naming convention for all nets
  - Tried connecting two seperate schematics - DONE
  	- If two nets have the same net name, they will be automatically connected when converting to PCB
  	  - This confirms that we can all work on seperate schematics
  - Finished power supply schematic
 
## To-Do
  - Go over analog connections
  - All of us:
  	- Go through EAGLE libaries and figure out the exact part names of components (dimensions)
  	- For now use smallest component can replace later
  - Albert:
  	- Try using Design Spark account to download EAGLE part
  	- Make Digital connections on EAGLE
  - Mikael:
  	- Make voltage regular schematic
      

## Next Meeting Agenda
  - Discuss physical size of the board, come up with simple mechanical diagram
  - Continue work on ADS1299 Schematic
  - Discuss and finalize which pins we want to breakout and connect to test pads

## Next Meeting: Wednesday Sep 06, 2017, Clubhouse, Rm. 415
