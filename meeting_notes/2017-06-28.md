# Meeting Notes

Date:  June 28, 2017  
Time:  7pm  - 10 pm  
Location:  Clubhouse Meeting Room  
Attendees:  Albert, Musa  

## Agenda 

Digital: 
  - Was getting problems with SPIF flag not being set when doing a SPI transfer
    - Problem was with sketchy SPI setup in OpenBCI Arduino library - Fixed, will push after some more cleanup
  - Bootup code reads a mixture of 1's and 0's for register values, changes everytime 
  - Tested MISO by tying it to known inputs
    - If tied to ground, always reads 0's - as expected 
    - If tied to VDD, always reads 1's - as expected 
    - If left floating with and without wire, either get all 1's, all 0's, or a pattern of 1's or 0's
      - Does not look random, data comes out like:
        - 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 or 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
        -  Conclusion: Arduino pins are biased towards 1 or 0, need to make sure ADS can drive MISO pin rail-to-rail (can probe with a digital oscilliscope)
  - Next steps: Try reading MISO pin with analogRead (and maybe plot it). Find and install OpenBCI library that can interface directly with SPI to test code flow
  
Software:  
  - Flashed SD card with Raspbian
  - Next steps: Begin coding the Raspberry Pi (Starting with C, until more familiar with Python syntax)
