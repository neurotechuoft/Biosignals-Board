Pins in need of a breakout (from PCB Team)

- Control
	- DRDY
	- CLKSEL
	- CLK
	- PWDN
	- RESET
	- START

- SPI
	- CS
	- SCLK
	- DIN
	- DOUT

- Power
	- *VCAP1*
	- VCAP2
	- VCAP3
	- VCAP4
	- VREFP
	- VREFN

Pins not needed to breakout:
- GPIO 1
- GPIO 2
- GPIO 3
- GPIO 4


Albert's suggested edits:

(Everything below assumes that "breakout" means that this pin will be connected to a header pin to be driven/probed externally. Hence, power pins are excluded from the list)

*Perfboard (Test board) Breakout Pins* 

- Digital
  - Communication:
    - !CS    (SPI)
    - SCLK  (SPI)
    - DIN   (SPI)
    - DOUT  (SPI)
    - DRDY  (ADS1299 - specific)

  - Control:
    - !PWDN (ADS1299 - specific)
    - START (ADS1299 - specific)
    - RESET (ADS1299 - specific)  

  - Configuration:
    - CLKSEL

- Analog
  - VREFP
  - VREFN
    
- Internal Breakouts (These pins can be probed to monitor internal on-chip components)
  - CLK   -> Can be configured to output buffered system clock
  - VCAP1 -> Connected to bandgap reference. Can be probed to check analog circuitry power-up
